    <h1>ACCOMMODATION</h1>
    <p>As this area of Cornwall is particularly busy during the summer months, it is important to book your accommodation as early as possible. We have given a number of options ranging from a couple of nights in a B&B to a weeklong stay in a holiday let.</p>
    <p>We wanted to let you know that, if you can spare the time, the two of us and our families will be in Cornwall for a number of days before and after the wedding. We would obviously love for you to make the most of your time here with us but we also understand that you may have other commitments.</p>
    <p>We know the area well so if you have any questions about accommodation please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us: <a href="mailto:benjaminandsuzy@gmail.com">benjaminandsuzy@gmail.com</a></p>
